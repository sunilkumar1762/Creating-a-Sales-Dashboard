# Dynamic Sales Insights Dashboard

Objective: To develop an interactive sales dashboard using SQL and Power BI to visualise
sales performance, trends, and insights.

Steps:
1. Gather sales data from various sources (e.g., databases, Excel files).
2. Use SQL to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and duplicates.
3. Write SQL queries to aggregate data by relevant dimensions (e.g., time, region,
product).
4. Import the cleaned and aggregated data into Power BI.
5. Create visualisations in Power BI, such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.
6. Add filters and slicers to make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly.
Expected Outcome: An interactive sales dashboard that provides clear insights into sales
performance, trends over time, and regional/product breakdowns.
